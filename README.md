Massive Pixel Environment (MPE) is a [Processing](http://processing.org/) library for easily extending sketches to distributed display environments. MPE was developed at the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-projects/a-thousand-words) and aims to make it easy to prototype visualizations for otherwise difficult to use distributed systems. MPE is compatible with the lastest Processing versions and supports full compatibility with advanced featuresets of OpenGL.

In MPE:
* Each node in a cluster runs an instance of the Processing sketch application
* The Processing sketch is easily launched across the cluster through the use of a single configuration file
* Support for all features of Processing is available
