{"name":"MassivePixelEnvironment","tagline":"The MassivePixelEnvironment (MPE) is a Processing library for easily extending sketches to distributed display environments.","body":"### Welcome to the homepage for the Massive Pixel Environment library for the Processing Programming Language.\r\n\r\nYou can download the library with the links above. It can be installed by copying the archive contents to your sketchbook's _libraries_ folder.\r\n\r\n## About\r\nMPE was developed at the [Texas Advanced Computing Center](http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-projects/a-thousand-words) and aims to make it easy to prototype visualizations for otherwise difficult to use distributed systems. MPE is compatible with the lastest Processing versions and supports full compatibility with advanced featuresets of OpenGL. MPE's lead developer is @bmwesting.\r\n\r\nIn MPE:\r\n* Each node in a cluster runs an instance of the Processing sketch application\r\n* The Processing sketch is easily launched across the cluster through the use of a single configuration file\r\n* Support for all features of Processing is available\r\n\r\n## Getting Started:\r\n\r\n* [MPE Simple Guide](https://github.com/TACC/MassivePixelEnvironment/wiki/MassivePixelEnvironment-HowTo)\r\n\r\n## Other Links\r\n* [MPE Project Page](http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-software/most-pixels-ever-cluster-edition)\r\n* [MPE Paper/Abstract @ IEEE Vis](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6676512/VisualizationLaboratory/Posters/mpe-poster-visweek.pdf)\r\n* [MPE Paper @ CHI 2013](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6676512/VisualizationLaboratory/Papers/powerwall-chi-2013/mpe-powerwall.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n![NEH](http://www.neh.gov/files/neh_logo_horizlarge.jpg)\r\nThis work was made possible by funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Grant:HD-51475-11, A [Thousand Words: Advanced Visualization for the Humanities](http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/tacc-projects/a-thousand-words).\r\n\r\n## Awards and News\r\n![MPE Award](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8366/8491717055_476f79f51d.jpg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
